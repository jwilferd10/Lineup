## :wave: Description: 
<p> 
Lineup is a To-Do list application that allows users to create and edit their tasks. Additionally users can delete either one task item, or clear the list altogether. Also featured is the users current date and time. Lineup is brought to life through Bootstrap, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, FontAwesome and work. 

My initial reason for creating Lineup was to practice and reinforce concepts that I've learned by creating a simple yet usuable application. However since the goal of this project was to improve, I decided to avoid using a CDN like momentJS and used JavaScript's Date object to collect both the time and date instead. Furthermore I wanted to emphasize the application by giving it a fun yet simple design. 

It's my hope that this application helps YOU out in anyway possible. Feel free to take a look through the files, Happy Coding!
